                    <div class="text-left">
                        <p>We are a group of people working on this amazing mission of teaching people how to make things out of the many things they have around them. This means they dont have to buy alot of staff to make them but to simply use the old staff they have to make something new. Isn't that great!!!</p>
                        <p>Old things can be clothes, bags, shoes, matresses, think of anything that can be made out of it and do it.</p>
                        <p>Innovation, creativity, imagination is what we bring out of people. This also releases the stress or the mentality of being unemployed, you can start up somthing out of it.</p>
                        <p>Join us and we create those ideas together. See you soon!!!</p>
